      <h2>A Special Letter</h2>
      <bdi><p>Dear Dno,</p>
      <p>As you see, this website was made with my sweat and blood and tears (quite literally, but I'm quoting you :P)</p>
      <p>The initial idea was supposed to be a 3D game, but I only got the output of headaches and failed alien shaped objects.</p>

      <p>I considered switching to a 2D game as my skills would qualify for that, and I actually started it but did not continue yet, as I wanted it as a cheerup gift with certain letters, especially after failing to actually give you a part of it in real life instead of just a game or a website.</p>
      <p class="hint" style="color: #cdaf18;">(hint: the <a href="sunflowers.html" style="color: #af6f21;">sunflowers</a> page)</p>

      <p>Anyways, I did NOT give up on making it 3D at first. But man, this 3D shit is more complicated than I thought.</p>

        <p>So here it is, a normal 2D website.</p>
        <p>Well, you might wonder why I've chosen those specific flowers right?</p>
        <p>You might guess it's because they're the ones Lego made, WRONG!!!</p>

        <p>I said it a lot, I remember everything about you (and might even note things to not forget, yesyesyes it's that serious) and I once asked, very long ago, about your favorite flowers.</p>
        <p>You mentioned these exact ones.</p>

        <p>So I tried to use my creativity and combine two things you love: Legos and those flowers (smart, I know)</p>

        <p>I've also put one of your fav care bears in the header, and since it's cheer bear, I think it actually fits perfectly.</p>

        <p>Finally you see there's the music player, it was supposed to have the functionality to play in the background, but as far as I know web browsers restrict the auto play thing. So I've made it like that. Play the default one then enjoy checking all the letters :)</p>

        <p>I hope the website will actually be something you return to whenever life feels heavy. I've tried to put all my poetic writing skills into those letters, although I think this is not the best I could've came up with but it's still something genuine.</p>

        <p>Love always and forever,</p>
        <p>Dino
